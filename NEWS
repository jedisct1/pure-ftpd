 - Fix packaging issues, especially when the server isn't installed in the
default paths

 - Fix an infinite loop that could lead to a client process burning a CPU
core if the client didn't disconnect properly. Reported by Thomas Min and
Margus Kaidja.
 - Handle fake download resumes the traditional way for the sake of being
compatible with weird clients that insist on doing that.

upload actually starts.
 - PAM is now enabled by default on OSX.
 - Switch euid to the _pure-ftpd account (unless it's nonexistent) in the

run-time directory.
 - Support for building a FTPS (implicit SSL/TLS) server, using
--with-implicittls

 - A new, nice-looking PDF version of the documentation is now available from
http://www.pureftpd.org/readme.pdf . Contributed by Torgny Wernersson.

IPv6.

 - Pure-FTPd can now produce WU-FTPd (xferlog) compatible log files.
 - Support for Rendezvous was added on MacOS X.

 - UTF-8 characters are now supported in file names. A new switch,
--without-unicode, can be used to filter out non-latin characters.

* Version 1.0.17a:
 - An old standing issue has been fixed : ungracefully aborted transfers
caused the session to exit without removing ftpwho entry and atomic files.
This fix also speeds up ftpwho and peruserlimit.

* Version 1.0.17:
 - The SSL certificate file can now be changed through a new configuration
switch, --with-certfile. It doesn't depend on sysconfdir any more and it
defaults to the original location : /etc/ssl/private/pure-ftpd.pem .
 - Shadowed NIS accounts and MacOS X Panther system accounts are now processed
by the pure-pwconvert tool.
 - The server doesn't reject users any more on Linux when capabilities are
used.
 - The documentation has been improved (man pages, README, FAQ, typos).
 - Optimizations have been made.
 - SO_REUSEPORT is now used on FreeBSD to always bind the ftp-data port.
 - SSL-related error messages are now more explicit.
 - The SITE TIME command has been implemented.
 - The sample PAM configuration file has been rewritten.
 - A logfile parser has been added to the contribs.
 - MacOS X Panther specific instructions have been added.
 - Upload is now atomic. A file is uploaded with a temporary name and it gets
its final name only once the upload has been completed. If a file already
exists with the same name, the content can be preserved until the new content
has been fully transfered (using the new --notruncate run-time switch). Web
servers will no more serve partially transfered files during uploads.
  The new handling of uploads also limits the races in virtual quota handling.

* Version 1.0.16c:
 - The PAM backend and the CGI mode were accidentally broken in version
1.0.16b. This version fixes both issues.

 - Minor optimizations have been made.
 - IPv4 and IPv6 addresses will now listen for connections even
without the -4 switch on NetBSD and FreeBSD.

 - pure-uploadscript was broken in 1.0.16 due to a typo and sometimes it
wouldn't work on some systems.

* Version 1.0.16:
 - Authentication is now working on Solaris with shadow/NIS. Based
upon a patch by Axel Apitz <a_apitz@pixelpark.com>.

* Version 1.0.15:
 - A turkish translation has been added. Thanks to Mehmet Cokcevik

handling of upload scripts, to the pure-pw command and to the
automatic creation of home directories.

list").

port (using a WIN32_ANON_DIR environment variable).

professionnal (ie. boring).
 - Transfer speed on BSD systems has been improved.
 - The license of the whole package has changed from GPL to a simplified
BSD license.

* Version 1.0.14:
 - Privilege separation has been introduced. When this feature is
enabled, each client session spawns two processes communicating over a
private channel : a restricted trusted part and the main part that
definitely revokes all privileges after authentication and chroot().
Add --with-privsep to ./configure in order to enable that feature.
 - Automatic detection of Virtuozzo was added.
 - Forced passive IP addresses (-P) can now work with gateways whoose
addresses are dynamic (DSL and cable modem users), using symbolic host
names.

works for you, there's absolutely no need to upgrade.

more (Thanks to Ying-Chieh Liao) .

slashes.

hasn't been started before.

any more.

professional-looking messages.

thanks to Emmanuel Hocdet.

enabled (Claudiu) .

 - "make -f Makefile.gui" should work again on most today's Linux
distributions.
 - The Win32 port was slightly improved. The server is now compiled as
non-root (but binds port 21) and ASCII transfers are not mangled any
more.
 - The RPM initialization script (redhat.init, installed as
/etc/init.d/pure-ftpd) now calls pure-config.pl . It means that
/etc/sysconfig/pure-ftpd is deprecated and you must use
/etc/pure-ftpd.conf instead.

compatibility.
